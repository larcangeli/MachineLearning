## üìà Progression Pathway

### For Beginners:
1. Start with `EXERCISES.md` to build practical skills
2. Move to basic exercises in `EXAM_EXERCISES.md` for mathematical understanding
3. Gradually tackle more advanced problems as confidence grows

### For University Students:
1. Use `EXAM_EXERCISES.md` as primary study material for exams
2. Supplement with `EXERCISES.md` for practical implementation experience
3. Challenge yourself with `ADVANCED_EXERCISES.md` for deeper understanding

### For Advanced Practitioners:
1. Focus on `ADVANCED_EXERCISES.md` for cutting-edge techniques
2. Use `EXAM_EXERCISES.md` to solidify theoretical foundations
3. Refer to `EXERCISES.md` for quick implementation references

## üéØ How to Use These Exercises

### Study Schedule Integration
- **Daily Practice:** Choose 1-2 exercises matching your current week's topics
- **Exam Preparation:** Focus on relevant exercises from `EXAM_EXERCISES.md` 2-3 weeks before exams
- **Project Building:** Use `EXERCISES.md` for portfolio development
- **Research Skills:** Tackle `ADVANCED_EXERCISES.md` for deeper exploration

### Assessment and Grading
Each exercise file includes:
- **Difficulty ratings** (‚≠ê to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
- **Time estimates** for completion
- **Grading rubrics** for self-assessment
- **Learning objectives** clearly stated

### Implementation Languages
All exercises support multiple programming languages:
- **Python** (recommended for beginners)
- **R** (excellent for statistics-focused problems)
- **MATLAB** (for mathematical computations)
- **Mathematics by hand** (for theoretical understanding)

## üèÜ Success Tips

### Effective Practice Strategy
1. **Start Simple:** Always begin with the easiest version of a concept
2. **Build Gradually:** Progress from basic to advanced systematically
3. **Implement Everything:** Code every algorithm you study mathematically
4. **Verify Results:** Compare your implementations with library versions
5. **Document Learning:** Keep notes on insights and challenges

### Common Mistake Prevention
- **Don't skip mathematical derivations** - they build deep understanding
- **Don't rely only on libraries** - implement core algorithms from scratch
- **Don't rush through exercises** - take time to understand each step
- **Don't work in isolation** - discuss problems with peers and communities

### Time Management
- **Practical Exercises:** 1-3 hours each
- **Exam Exercises:** 30-60 minutes each
- **Advanced Exercises:** 2-8 hours each (some are multi-day projects)

## üìû Getting Help

### When You're Stuck
1. **Read the theory first** - Review relevant PDF materials
2. **Check the hints** - Many exercises include helpful guidance
3. **Start simpler** - Move to an easier exercise and return later
4. **Ask for help** - Use course forums, Stack Overflow, or study groups

### Verification and Testing
- **Compare with examples** provided in each exercise
- **Use toy datasets** to verify your implementations
- **Test edge cases** to ensure robust solutions
- **Cross-check** with library implementations when available
