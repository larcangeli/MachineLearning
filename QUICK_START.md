## ‚ö° Quick Reference Commands

### Python ML Essentials
```python
# Data loading and exploration
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Basic exploration
df.info()
df.describe()
df.head()

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data=df, x='feature_name')
plt.show()

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### First Day Checklist
- [ ] Environment setup complete
- [ ] Can run Python/R without errors
- [ ] Successfully loaded a dataset
- [ ] Created first visualization
- [ ] Progress tracker initialized

## üéØ Study Schedule Template

### Daily Routine (2-3 hours)
```
üïí Time Block 1 (60 min): Theory
- Read PDF material
- Take detailed notes
- Research unclear concepts

üïí Time Block 2 (60-90 min): Practice  
- Work on exercises
- Implement algorithms
- Debug and experiment

üïí Time Block 3 (15-30 min): Reflection
- Update progress tracker
- Plan next day
- Review key insights
```

### Weekly Routine
- **Monday-Friday:** Daily study (2-3 hours)
- **Saturday:** Project work (3-4 hours)
- **Sunday:** Review and planning (1-2 hours)

## üö® Common First-Week Pitfalls

### Avoid These Mistakes
1. **Perfectionism:** Don't spend hours on installation issues
2. **Information Overload:** Stick to the plan, avoid rabbit holes
3. **Passive Learning:** Always implement what you learn
4. **Isolation:** Join ML communities early
5. **Inconsistency:** Better to study 1 hour daily than 7 hours once

### When You Get Stuck
1. **Google the error message** - Most issues are common
2. **Check Stack Overflow** - Programming solutions
3. **Use the course materials** - Answers are often in the PDFs
4. **Ask for help** - Use Reddit r/LearnMachineLearning
5. **Take a break** - Sometimes clarity comes after rest
